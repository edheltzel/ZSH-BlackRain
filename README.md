# BlackRain

A zsh theme for OH-My-ZSH that is git aware

`ZSH-BlackRain` supports [ZSH Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) and [ZSH Autocomplete](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions), as well as being git aware and supports the usage of the Powerline fonts.
